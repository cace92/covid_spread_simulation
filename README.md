# Virus spread simulation
Project done as amusement during pandemic lockdown in 2020.
It does not follow any specific model, but it is the result of simple rational deductions.
1) Fix parameters in settings.py
2) Precompute moves running main.py
3) If you want visual simulation running plot.py, otherwise you simply find results in the two outputted excel files.
